# No Service

 - A Flutter project created to help users not be bored in a situation where there is no internet such as boarding plane or ride subway/train. This app compiles of mini games such as Pong, Tetris, Wordle, and Snake. User can navigate between games by scrolling downward or upward (similar to tiktok navigation style).

 - I am planning on developing this app to be consisted of more games and include offline multiplayer feature, highscore system, and achievement system.

Snapshots off the app:
